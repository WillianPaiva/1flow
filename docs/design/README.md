# Design principles

Design of the 1flow web application (and others to come) is modeled after a technique called "emotional design".

I (Olivier Cort√®s, BDFL) personally try to apply the emotional design principles as much as possible, but beiing a small team of 1 person, you will surely find rough edges that do not match the design criterias and requirements.

When you find some areas that seem to be out of the project personna, I encourage you to submit a pull request, and argue your change proposal.

# Persona

You will find the project persona near the current file, in the same folder.
If you are french, willing to contribute to the design, and have very good english speaking skills, please submit a PR to translate the persona in English.

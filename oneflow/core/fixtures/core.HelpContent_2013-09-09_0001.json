Your import status is updated every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nUpon completion, the number of imported articles may be less than the number\r\nof processed articles due to duplicate content in Google data.\r\n\r\nAbout the approximate ETA\u2026 Well\u2026 Given the nature of the data we fetch\r\nfrom Google, it's **very** approximate. Don't rely on it; we don't do.\r\nThe import will probably end before the ETA. It pleased our developer\r\nto display it."

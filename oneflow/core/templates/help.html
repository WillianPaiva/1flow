## Google Reader import

The Google Reader import takes places in the background. You can safely
logout of **1flow** or close your browser window without disrupting it.

Importing data will take longer if many users are importing at once as we
have finite computing resources. Your import status is updated every 5 seconds.

Upon completion, the number of imported articles may be less than the number
of processed articles due to duplicate content in Google data.

About the approximate ETA… Well… Given the nature of the data we fetch
from Google, it's **very** approximate. Don't rely on it; we don't do.
The import will probably end before the ETA. It pleased our developer
to display it.

## Reaching us

If you need to reach real people, you can use:

- the **feedback form** (on the right), which links to our help forums,
- the **chat** widget, to which we are connected in real time (it's not a robot!).

Note: If you use twitter to contact us, please be patient: we use it primarily
for publishing informations and don't read it very regularly.

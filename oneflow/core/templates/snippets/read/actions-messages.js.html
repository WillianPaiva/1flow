    No need for a "var", this variable is already declared in read-one.js
    The current included file is hack to avoid the full Django Javascript
    i18n workflow. This will change incrementally in the future.

    BTW, this file is really a JS-only content, but Django won't pick
    it up during make messages with a .JS extension. It's starting to
    be a very real hack…

1flow project started in January 2013. Development begun in April 2013, as a new generation watch tool. Since then, goals have extended to make it become:

- a citizen project to enhance information quality and reinforce links between information consumers and producers,
- a collaborative editing platform,
- a trusted and decentralized storage space across the internet for sensible and common information.
